# Touch_slider
A Swipe based Carousel. It works on both mobile and desktop and supports any html content.

# How to set up
The set up is fairly easy because The repository has only html, css and JS code. Make sure to keep "img" folder in the same directory as other files.

# Features
- Works for both mobile and desktop. Swipe feature on mobile works as fine as mouse slide on desktop
- Carousel slide can contain any HTML content. My slide contains header tag and JPG image.
- Slide is animated
- Next and previous buttons to go to next and previous slide.
- Numbers at the bottom of the webpage can be used to go to that particular number of slide.
- Supports Infinite option. (Using lastClone and firstClone technique)

# Drawbacks
- Changing orientation can sometimes cause slight issues (sometimes image will not be at the center)
- When you first load the webPage, it will show a little unneccesary animation. - It is a feature not a bug ;) 
- Please excuse my overuse of commented console.log, it really healps me to understand the flow of my code

# Notes for Scandiweb
- I have left comments inside my code for you about like/dislike button
